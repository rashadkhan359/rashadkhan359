## Who Am I?

I'm a curious, tea-powered developer with a passion for **building clean, efficient, and scalable web apps**. By day, I lead the development of dynamic, high-performing Laravel projects, and by night, you might catch me tinkering with APIs, learning new technologies, or getting lost in code refactors. ✨

I love the challenge of turning business problems into elegant tech solutions. Also, **bugs** are just my way of having _extra_ fun in the debugging universe 🐛🚀.

## 🔥 Things I Work With

```yaml
Front-End: 
  - JavaScript (ES6+), React (Vite), Laravel Livewire, Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap
Back-End: 
  - PHP (7-8.3), Laravel (7-11), RESTful APIs, OOP 
Databases: 
  - MySQL, MongoDB, Redis (for when my data needs speed)
Cloud & DevOps: 
  - AWS, Docker, Hostinger, CI/CD, GitHub
```


## 👨‍💻 What I’m Currently Up To:
  - Leading 10+ Laravel projects as the go-to Full-Stack dev at Quantum IT Innovation 🏆.
  - Building cool stuff with React, Tailwind, and Laravel, because who doesn’t love a good front-end/back-end combo?
  - Mentoring interns and interviewing candidates—because sharing knowledge is caring 🤓.
  - Always optimizing codebases and hunting for performance bottlenecks like a code detective 🕵️‍♂️.

## 🌱 Fun Facts About Me
- I might secretly be powered by tea ☕.
- My brain thinks therefore I'm 🧠.
- When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me binge-watching tech videos, astronomy, or optimizing something in real life too.
- Yes, I do code dreams. Don’t ask.
